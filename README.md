Problem Definition:

You are to write 3 Prolog functions. 

1. Write a function listLen to find the length of a given list. You cannot use any predefined function that returns the length of a list.

E.g. listLen(X,[5,2,4,6,2]).

Answer: X = 5

2. Write a function dropK that removes the K'th element from a list.

E.g. dropK(X, [6,3,5,2,8], 2).

Answer: X = [6, 5, 2, 8]

3. Write a function divide that given an index X and a list L, your function creates 2 lists L1 and L2, such that L1 consists of all elements until X, and L2 consists of all the remaining elements of L.

E.g. divide(X, Y, [3,1,9,5,8], 3).

Answer: X = [3, 1, 9],
Y = [5, 8]
